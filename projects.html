          <h2>Food Blogging Website</h2>
          <p>A full-stack food blogging platform built as a university group project with a team of five. Users can
            browse
            articles on the homepage, register an account, and log in to create, edit, and delete their own blog posts
            using a rich WYSIWYG text editor with image upload support. The app includes a search feature, a likes
            system
            with animations, real-time username validation during registration, and an auto-saving profile editor. Built
            with SvelteKit on the frontend, Node.js and Express on the backend, and SQLite as the database,
            communicating
            via a RESTful API with JWT-based authentication.</p>

          <h2>Pokemon Battle Simulator</h2>
          <p>A Pokémon battle simulator built with SvelteKit as a university frontend assignment. Two random Pokémon are
            selected from a full 151-entry Pokédex and face off in turn-based combat, with each attack dealing random
            damage between 10–20 HP, with a 10% chance of a critical hit dealing 40 damage. The app is decomposed into
            six
            Svelte components covering the header, Pokémon cards, HP bar, attack button, music player, and reset button.
            Battle animations include a smooth HP bar transition, floating damage indicators, a flashing HP bar when
            below
            20%, and a crown/defeat overlay on the winner and loser. The design is inspired by the original Game Boy
            Pokémon games, featuring an 8-bit font, pixel art background, and toggleable 8-bit battle music. The app is
            fully responsive, displaying side-by-side on desktop and stacked on mobile.</p>

          <h2>Bulls and Cows Game</h2>
          <p>A Java console-based implementation of the classic Bulls & Cows code-breaking game, built across two
            assignment increments. Players can choose between Single Player mode (guessing a computer-generated code) or
            Player vs. Computer mode (both players guess each other's codes simultaneously). The computer opponent
            features three AI difficulty levels: Easy (random guessing), Medium (avoids repeating previous guesses), and
            Hard (uses a process-of-elimination strategy that intelligently prunes a list of all possible codes after
            each
            guess). The game also supports six-digit hexadecimal codes loaded from an external file, result saving to a
            .txt file, input validation throughout, and a randomised player order at the start of each match. A JUnit
            test
            suite covers the core code validation and hexadecimal computer logic.</p>

          <h2>Colour Swap</h2>
          <p>A Java arcade game developed as a university final project, built using Java Swing for the UI. The player
            controls a circle that can switch between red and blue using the spacebar, moving around the screen with
            arrow
            keys to collect matching-coloured shapes while avoiding opposite-coloured ones. The game features multiple
            shape types, a robot player mode, a title screen, how-to-play screen, and game over screen with score
            display.
            The project was built incrementally and follows a strict MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture, with
            collision detection, a shape spawning system, and a listener pattern for game state updates. A full JUnit
            test
            suite covers all core shape and player behaviours.</p>
